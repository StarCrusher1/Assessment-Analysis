<h1>WA2 Flask Assessment</h1>

<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>I felt that there was a need for students to get their marks properly broken down by question and topic. This was done by my chemistry teacher in secondary school and I felt that this would be an arduous job to create everything by hand, so a web app using a database would be a much easier way to do so as only the data for each student needs to be entered. This saves the teachers time trying to write comments about each student's individual performance, as the program will analyse each student's performance and give helpful advice.</p>


<h1>Purpose of Assessment Analysis</h1>
<p>It helps to give students a detailed breakdown for marks in every question in a H2 Math assessment, showing the number of marks lost for each topic, not attempting parts or entire questions
and careless mistakes. From there, the app will then give recommendations for the student on which topics he should prioritise revising and state exam strategies for students. </p>

<h1>How it is built</h1>
<p>This was built using Flask, which uses sqlite3 module to obtain data from a database. This data would then be analysed by the program and output in a file, which is only shown after the user manages to log in successfully.</p>

<h1>Challenges encountered</h1>
<p>As this was my first web app, attempting to successfully run the login page and output the data was a challenge. Additionally, it was also my first time creating a database, and it was difficult to decide what data should be placed into the database.</p>

<h1>Accomplishments</h1>
<p>After a few days of hard work, the app was able to achieve its basic functionalities.</p>

<h1>What we learned</h1>
<p>It is very important to plan early and generate a good workflow at least 2 weeks before attempting to work on the app, and that sometimes, when certain features are too difficult to implement, it is necessary to discard them for now and reintroduce them in a later stage when working on it.</p>

<h1>What's next</h1>
<p>Additional features will be introduced, such as more detailed analysis, and will also bring users to a page where they will be provided with quickfire questions in order to practice their answering skills, to help prepare them for exams.</p>
