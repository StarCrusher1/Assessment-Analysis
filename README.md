<h1>WA2 Flask Assessment</h1>

<h1>Purpose of Assessment Analysis</h1>
<p>It helps to give students a detailed breakdown for marks in every question in a H2 Math assessment, showing the number of marks lost for each topic, not attempting parts or entire questions
and careless mistakes. From there, the app will then give recommendations for the student on which topics he should prioritise revising and state exam strategies for students. </p>
